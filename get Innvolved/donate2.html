    <h1>Donate in Kind</h1>
    <p>We are on a beautiful journey of bringing education to the kids of the marginalized society of Hingalganj of the
        Sunderbans. But this journey would not have been possible without our donors. We are thankful for your continued
        patronage. Donate to sustain our vigil of educating the kids from the under-served background, who, without
        educational interventions, would have taken to vulnerable means of livelihood when grown up.

        We have listed down some requirements the kids and community regularly need. We shall be more than happy to
        receive an in-kind donation. Thank you for your efforts towards ensuring community empowerment.
    </p>

    <p>The cost of education does not end with tuition fees. One needs good books and study materials to grasp the
        knowledge of the subject. At Swapnapuron Siksha Niketan, we are building our library with a state-of-the-art
        facility. It will help enrich the students through ages. Donate for the cost of books of the library.

    <p>Books and accessories are a must for us to study in school. However, most of our students come from families
        whose income are meagre and unstable. Access to quality education kits will mean a lot towards helping spread
        quality education among these under-served children.

    <p>The school needs furniture and maintenance of the same to function properly. But the cumulative cost of arranging
        for these in the whole school is havoc. Though droplets form oceans and we are thankful that our patrons
        understand that and extend their donations. Donate for school furniture.
