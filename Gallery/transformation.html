    <h1>Transformation Stories</h1>
    <p>However difficult our situation or profound our anguish, we always retain the capacity to light the flame of
        encouragement. This light dispels not only the darkness of others’ suffering, but also that which envelops our
        own heart. <b>Daisaku Ikeda</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        At Swapnopuron, one of the key drivers has been to extend an opportunity to the marginalised children of the
        remote villages of Sunderbans, to get quality education. The journey towards this has been ridden with numerous
        challenges – abject poverty, limited livelihood opportunities, inaccessibility and unaffordability of proper
        health care, inherent patriarchal division of labour, vagaries of nature – to name few.
    </p>
    <p>
        Reality is harsh. It can be cruel and ugly. Yet no matter how much we grieve over our environment and
        circumstances nothing will change. What is important is not to be defeated, to forge ahead bravely. If we do
        this, a path will open before us. <b>Daisaku Ikeda</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        And amidst all the adversity that severely tested our perseverance, did we find the courage to forge on. We have
        been touched by the lives of the children and have been privileged to have made a difference.

            <h1>AKASH SARDAR</h1>
            <p>“Bhaat toh geleo peye jabo kintu porashuno korar sujog sikkha sob somoy payoa jai na eikhane” (tr: Even
                if there’s no food right now, we will surely get it later, but we don’t get the opportunity to gain
                knowledge here every day). This one statement voices the emotions of many living in the remote areas of
                Sunderbans. Coming from a time when there was no hope in education, Swapnopuron has built a community
                that looks forward to a better future.

                Akash, a bright young boy, was abandoned by his parents at an early age. He was raised by his relatives
                who wanted to ensure a secure and happy life for him. His family is always in the struggle to make ends
                meet, but they wanted to make sure that Akash gets the education he deserves. From not being able to
                read or write at all, to being one of the brightest students at school, Swopnopuron came as a
                life-changing turn in the pathway of Akash's life. When he is not in the classroom, you will find him at
                the school library, reading and dreaming of his future. Akash has ambitions to join government services
                and help his family break away from the shackles of poverty. With the efforts and guidance of the
                teachers at Swapnopuron, he has been receiving quality English-medium education that helps him not only
                in dreaming big but also in developing the skillset to achieve those dreams. Akash's aunt, who married
                at an early age and was deprived of opportunities, is immensely grateful for the way Swapnopuron has
                impacted Akash and the children of the community.</p>

            <h1>YAZDANI GAZI</h1>
            <p>
                One of the teachers of Swapnopuron Shiksha Niketan (SSN) – Mr Palash Gaz – was once approached by a
                young, enthusiastic child whose father could not take proper care of his studies. Moved by the eagerness
                of the child to learn, Mr Gaz spoke to Yazdani Gazi’s (the child’s) father and tried to convince him
                about the importance of the psycho-social development of his son. After multiple back-and-forth visits,
                meetings and persuasion, Yazdani’s parents agreed to send him to school.

                Just like most of the families in Sunderbans, the Gazis were poverty-stricken. With so much to pay for
                and so little earnings, can they bear the cost of education? The family was confused, but their
                indecision was settled by the silver lining – the promise of education to end the vicious circle of
                poverty.

                Yazdani is currently studying in Class 1, and is performing exceptionally. Apart from his studies, he
                has garnered a keen interest in sports. With the efforts of his teachers, support from his parents, and
                his own determination, he has been able to excel in both academic and co-curricular spheres!

            <h1>SADIA PARVIN</h1>
            <p>
                Sadia Parvin, studying in class 1, is truly an exceptional student! After joining Swapnopuron Shiksha
                Niketan (SSN), she excelled in her studies, but the teachers soon started to notice some unusual
                behaviour. She stayed aloof in the classroom and always had a blank look on her face. Despite being one
                of the finest students and having a literate and secure family background, something was definitely
                troubling her. The teachers of the school decided to find out what was wrong and soon realized that her
                overweight agitated her. She suffered a sense of inferiority and her confidence lessened day by day. The
                teachers decided to remove this social barrier by constantly providing her with confidence. With
                positive reinforcement and motivation, they tried to boost her conviction by placing her name on the
                classroom board, praising her participation. As a result, Sadia started gaining self-confidence and
                changes in her behaviour could be very well seen.

                With the steady efforts put in by the teachers, and a healthy environment provided to her, Sadia was
                able to overcome the obstacle of social prejudice. Not only has she excelled overall in her academic and
                social life, but she has also become a source of inspiration to all the children around her. It is a
                delight for us to see a smile on her face again. Indeed, one of the best gifts of training is
                confidence!

            <h1>MEHEDI HASSAN</h1>
            <p>
                At a very young age, Mehedi's parents separated. Needless to say, this separation of primary family
                traumatised the child. He started behaving aggressively and showed a complete lack of social skills. His
                mother, perturbed by his behaviour, was hesitant to send Mehedi to school. The teachers of Swapnopuron
                Shishu Shiksha Niketan (SSSN) decided to visit the family and counsel them about the importance of
                education. After several meetings and consultations, Mehedi’s mother agreed to send her child to school
                with an assurance that he’d be provided not only with the best educational facilities but also with an
                atmosphere of love and care that he, like several other kids, was deprived of. Mehedi was admitted to
                the early education centre and was provided with a healthy social and academic environment. He is
                currently enrolled in Class 1 and his behaviour has changed significantly. He is focused on his studies
                and has developed social skills. His mother is also pleased with this positive impact on his behaviour.
                The Swapnopuron family wishes him all the success, and promises to provide many such children with a
                healthy and caring environment!

            <h1>SUMANA KHATUN</h1>
            <p>
                The story of Sumana starts not with her but with the resilience at the face of hardships faced by her
                grandmother.

                “Ami nije toh konodino porashuno korte parlam na, amar khub eccha j ami amar natni der bhalo kore porabo
                jai e hok r chai j ora chakri koruk” (tr: I had never got the opportunity to study, but will help my
                granddaughters to study at all costs and help them secure a job), told Sumana's grandmother. Her words
                reflect the dream of many guardians of the students at Swapnopuron Shishu Shiksha Niketan (SSSN).
                Hailing from an impoverished family, Sumana’s grandmother was never able to receive formal education.
                Being the eldest of the children, she spent her day helping her father make bidis while her other
                siblings went to school. She was married off at an early age, and household responsibilities became a
                part of her life. When her husband married another woman, she thought of taking a stance for herself and
                left with her 4-month-old child.

                Presently, her granddaughter (Sumana) is aged 10 and studies in Class 5. Before joining SSSN, Sumana
                used to play with mud all day, and like every other girl in her village, it seemed that she too would
                have been forced on the same path of misery. The local school was merely a place for all the kids of
                Hingalgunj to get their assured mid-day meals. Because of a lack of educational facilities, she lacked
                even a basic understanding of numbers and letters.



                The transformation started after joining Swapnopuron. Sumana has been performing very well in her
                academics and has learnt nursery rhymes too! Her grandmother cherishes the fact that she has the ability
                to speak and study the English language, and is receiving quality CBSE-curriculum-based education.
                Sumana has a completely changed personality and is independently aspiring to achieve greater things in
                her life and career. With a content heart, Sumana’s grandmother acknowledges that all this would not
                have been possible if she had not joined Swapnopuron.



                Sumana’s grandmother, like many of the women in Hingalgunj, could never see a future beyond the traps of
                poverty. The young child’s growth and aspiration to build a better life for herself makes her
                grandmother smile. Expressing her gratitude for the school, she says, “Amra sopneo bhabini j eto bhalo
                school amader ei gram e hobe. (Tr: We had never imagined that our village would have such a good
                school).”

                By enabling a pathway for resilient people like Sumana and her grandmother, Swapnopuron dedicates all
                its efforts in helping dreams manifest into a reality.

            <h1>ANU</h1>
            <p>
                “Aage amione dustumi kortam ekhon amar behaviour onek bodle geche” (Initially I was very mischievous but
                now I have changed my behaviour). This was said by one of the girls who was asked what impact did SSN
                bring to your life. Anu, lives with her grandmother and her elder sister in a thatched house which has
                no electricity. Initially she spent her time doing household chores but now her time is occupied with
                studies. It is hard for her to stay without her parents and often exhibited erratic behaviour. But when
                she was given the opportunity to study at SSN, she was elated. In spite of the daily adversities in
                terms of needs of standard life, she grabs every opportunity she finds to practice what has been taught
                at school. Apart from academic gains, she also speaks about how she changed herself after joining
                school. She also dreams to become an army officer and states that she had the courage to dream only
                because of the school. She rated the school with hundred hearts in an activity which asked the children
                to rate their school out of five hearts. She is looking forward to pursue further education and build
                herself into a strong and independent woman.

            <h1>SUMAIYA</h1>
            <p>
                Sumaiya now spends her time learning new things every day. Swopnopuron has rekindled her urge to pursue
                education in order to become successful in life. Married at an early age, Sumaiya’s mother studied till
                standard fifth and then had to abandon her education to take care of her ailing father. Sumaiya’s mother
                represents the reality of Indian society where daughters are married off to reduce the burden of the
                household. The inherent patriarchal division of labour in the Indian family forces a girl to assume
                responsibilities of the household at an early age and stay confined within its world. It also points to
                the vagaries of poverty – the inaccessibility and unaffordability of proper health care impacts the
                lives of the ailing’s patients primary kins. They strive hard to keep afloat their right to life. In
                this scenario Sumaiya’s mother and many more like her tells “Amara toh kono dino pelam na eisubidha ta,
                ami chai j amar meyetar jiboner saathe bhalo hok, amar moto naa hok” (We never had this kind of
                opportunity, I wish that my daughter’s doesn’t turn out to be like me, I hope her that she gets a good
                life.”) To most of the people, the parents serve as the primary role models but Sumaiya’s mother doesn’t
                want her daughter’s fate to be like her and she strives hard to avail this opportunity for her daughter.
                Swopnopuron thereby is a hope to parents like her who toils every day to change the trajectory of their
                daughters’ life.
