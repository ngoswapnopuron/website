                            Kolkata
                            for 15+ years. She has a deep understanding of pedagogy and has attended several workshops
                            on

                    <h4>THE FOUNDER STORY</h4>


                    
                    Strengthening the foundation literacy and numeracy of these children was critical for their
                    future and so in 2012 Satarupa developed an integrated model of Montessori and experiential
                    learning to make education more accessible, fun, and activity-based for rural children. She set
                    up Katakhali Swapnopuron Welfare Society along with other like-minded individuals. Her journey
                    has been documented in prestigious papers like The Hindu, Bloomberg, Better India and Global
                    Indian for her exemplary work in arena of educational and community empowerment of the
                    Sunderbans.</p>
